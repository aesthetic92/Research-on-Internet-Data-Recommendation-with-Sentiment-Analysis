#About Repo

This repository mainly writes system modeling and implement of my graduate paper. 

The repository is only for learn to study, without any commercial use. 
I also refer to some other people's codes, thanks to the people who wrote these techniques!

###This repository includes the following projects:

1. sentiment analysis
	a. read sentiment dictionary
	b. text word segmentation and other preprocessing
	c. calculate the sentiment score of sentence
	d. sum the sentiment score of text
2. e-commerce recommendation
	a. multiple linear regression prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	b. time series decomposition prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	c. gray prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	d. neural network prediction model based on sentiment analysis
3. real estate recommendation
	a. extension of multiple linear regression prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	b. extension of time series decomposition prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	c. extension of gray prediction model based on sentiment analysis
	d. extension of neural network prediction model based on sentiment analysis

This repository will be maintained for a long time. Of course, there are many mistakes and shortcomings, we can learn and progress together, thank you!
